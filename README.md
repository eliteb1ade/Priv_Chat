## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:full
   ```

   This will start both the backend server (port 3001) and frontend (port 5173).

3. **Open your browser:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:5173`
   - Enter your name and create a new room
   - Share the room link with others to chat together!

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to run the frontend and backend separately:

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
npm run server
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

## How It Works

1. **Create a Room**: Enter your name and click "Create Room" to generate a unique 8-character room ID
2. **Share the Link**: Copy the room link and share it with friends
3. **Start Chatting**: Send messages with your favorite emojis
4. **Auto-cleanup**: Rooms automatically delete after 5 minutes with no active users

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 + Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + Socket.IO
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections via Socket.IO
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with gradient themes

## Room Management

- Rooms are identified by unique 8-character IDs
- Maximum 100 messages per room (older messages are automatically removed)
- Rooms auto-delete after 5 minutes of inactivity
- Real-time user count and join/leave notifications

## Development

The app uses:
- Socket.IO for real-time bidirectional communication
- Express.js for the REST API endpoints
- React hooks for state management
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts

Perfect for quick team discussions, temporary support chats, or casual conversations without the need for accounts or permanent storage!
